							<p>My name is Nicholas Brillant, but I go by Nick. I repeated my junior year of high school to attend and play lacrosse at The Taft School in Connecticut. I am incredibly interested in pursuing the majors of business and computer science in college. I have always been a business-minded person. I pride myself on my amiability and ability to engage in conversation with those I have just met, and for years I have kept an ever-growing list of prospective business ideas that I would like to pursue. Throughout my high school career, I have attempted to enhance my proclivity for business by taking courses that will prepare me for a career in such a field. In my junior year at JH Rose high school, I took a business law course at my local community college. I performed very well in the class and subsequently searched for more courses that would sharpen me for the business world. At Taft I have taken both personal finance and marketing classes and I am currently enrolled in AP economics (micro and macro). I have found these courses riveting and they have provided me with countless tools to bring into my future profession.</p>
							<p>Due to the unbridled realm of creative possibility computer science provides, integrating an obsession with business will inevitably yield incredible results. Combining the two fields that I have been so immersed in would be an incredible opportunity that I hope to explore within the UM Foote Fellows Honors program. </p>
